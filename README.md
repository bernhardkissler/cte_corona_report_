# Current topics in Epistemology Report Group 1

This is the repository for the figures in our report on the coronavirus. It includes the graphics used and the notebook used to create them.

The name of the most current version of the notebook ends on "master". The other two implement different figures and include components not used in the final report.

To launch an interactive version of the current version of the notebook launch it on binder with the link below.
